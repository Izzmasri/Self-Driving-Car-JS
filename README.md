#🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulation (Pure JavaScript – No Libraries)
This project is a complete self-driving car simulation built entirely using vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries or machine learning frameworks. It demonstrates how neural networks, basic physics, and interactive graphics can be combined to simulate autonomous driving behavior directly in the browser.

🧠 Neural Network Architecture
Configurable neural network built from scratch using JavaScript.

Simple feedforward architecture with mutation capability.

Visualized in real-time while the AI is driving.

📖 Learning Goals
Understand how neural networks process sensor inputs to make driving decisions.

Learn about basic physics simulations (speed, friction, steering mechanics).

Explore collision detection and virtual sensor simulation.

Visualize neural network weights, activations, and biases interactively.

💡 Inspiration
Inspired by the idea of building intelligent systems from the ground up, without relying on pre-built libraries or frameworks. A hands-on approach to really understand how self-driving logic and AI decision-making works under the hood.
